# Gym Members Fitness Analysis

This project was made for my STAT 355 class at Purdue. This repository contains R code for analyzing gym members' fitness data using statistical techniques and visualizations. The dataset provides comprehensive metrics on age, gender, height, weight, average BPM, session duration, calories burned, and workout types, allowing for detailed analysis of fitness patterns and trends.

## Dataset
The analysis uses the [Gym Members Exercise Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/gym-members-exercise-dataset) from Kaggle. This dataset includes 973 samples with variables such as demographic data, fitness indicators, and workout details.

## Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Descriptive statistics, histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots.
- **Hypothesis Testing:** T-tests, ANOVA, and non-parametric tests to assess fitness trends and differences.
- **Regression Analysis:** Predictive modeling to determine factors influencing calories burned.
- **Visualizations:** Informative graphs for effective data presentation.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the R file in your preferred IDE.
3. Ensure the required libraries (`ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `corrplot`, `car`) are installed.
4. Run the R script to replicate the analysis.

## Requirements
- **R Version:** 4.0.0 or later.
- **Libraries:** `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `corrplot`, `car`.

## Results
Key insights:
- Significant gender differences in calories burned.
- Strong relationship between session duration and calorie expenditure.
- Predictive model leveraging multiple fitness variables with high accuracy.
